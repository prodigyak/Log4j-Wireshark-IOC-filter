# Log4j-Wireshark-IOC-filter
A quick and dirty Wireshark Filter to check for known IOC's in relation to Log4j
Please note this is not a surefire way to detect if you have been compromised by the Log4j exploit.  This will only allow you to test for outgoing connections to known IOC's.  It's very likely there are many more undocumented IP's that need to be added to this list.
